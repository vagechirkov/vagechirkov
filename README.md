### Hi, I’m Valerii! 👋

I studied Clinical Psychology as my first degree, and currently I am pursuing my master’s degree in Cognitive Neuroscience at the Humboldt University of Berlin. 🥰🧠🎓

For my thesis, I applied natural language processing and data analysis in the field of psychotherapy research. 🛋💬📊 At the same time, I worked with [Tommaso Fedele](https://github.com/tommytommy81) on epilepsy diagnostics. We analyzed MEG recordings of epileptic patients using machine learning to reveal seizure initialization and propagation. In Berlin, I decided to switch my research to social and cognitive psychology. Between April 2021 and September 2022, I worked at the [Social Intelligence Lab](https://social-intelligence-group.github.io/) at HU Berlin, where I’ve been developing behavioral experiments online and in virtual reality. 🕹🖥🔮 Then I worked at the [Center for Humans & Machines](https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/chm) at MPIB where I developed experimental frameworks to study cultural evolution and human-machine interaction 🤖 and did my internship at the [Center of Adaptive Rationality](https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/research/research-centers/adaptive-rationality) at MPIB where we studied collective behavior with multiplayer online experiments 🎮. I am currently doing my PhD at the [Science of intelligence cluster](https://www.scienceofintelligence.de/) 🎓 where we study [dynamics between collective search and collective avoidance](https://www.scienceofintelligence.de/research/researchprojects/project_51/) 🐟🐠

I excited about developing open source software to make scientific discoveries reproducible and more accessible! You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ValeriiChirkov).
