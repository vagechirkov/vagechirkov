### Hi, I’m Valerii! 👋

I am currently doing my PhD at the [Science of intelligence cluster](https://www.scienceofintelligence.de/) 🎓 where we study [dynamics between collective search and collective avoidance](https://www.scienceofintelligence.de/research/researchprojects/project_51/) 🐟🐠

I excited about developing open source software to make scientific discoveries reproducible and more accessible! You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ValeriiChirkov).
