### Hi, I’m Valerii! 👋

I studied Clinical Psychology as my first degree, and currently I am pursuing my master’s degree in Cognitive Neuroscience at the Humboldt University of Berlin. 🥰🧠🎓

For my thesis, I applied natural language processing and data analysis in the field of psychotherapy research. 🛋💬📊 At the same time, I worked with [Tommaso Fedele](https://github.com/tommytommy81) on epilepsy diagnostics. We analyzed MEG recordings of epileptic patients using machine learning to reveal seizure initialization and propagation. In Berlin, I decided to switch my research to social and cognitive psychology. Since April 2020, I’ve been working in the [Social Intelligence Lab](https://social-intelligence-group.github.io/), where I’ve been developing behavioral experiments online and in virtual reality. 🕹🖥🔮 I am currently working at the [Center for Humans & Machines](https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/chm) developing experimental frameworks to study cultural evolution and human-machine interaction 🤖 and doing my internship at the [Center of Adaptive Rationality](https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/research/research-centers/adaptive-rationality) where we study collective behavior with multiplayer online experiments 🎮.

I’m interested in developing open-source software for cognitive psychology and neuroscience. You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ValeriiChirkov).
